        I'm a jack of all trades, which is why i chose Full stack. Tossed in a
        tad of A.I too, cause why not? My crazy goal? To become the master of
        all trades. A bit ambitious, but I'm all in.

        My obsession with knowing everything, it's real. Right now, I'm neck
        deep in low-level programming and Linux. Can't decide if I should dive
        into Rust or Zig. Decisions, decisions.

        really get into the nitty gritty of tech. And that's where I'm headed.
